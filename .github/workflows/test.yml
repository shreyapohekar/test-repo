# insecure-pattern-lab.yml  (LAB ONLY - do not use in production)
# PURPOSE: show the *pattern* that causes risk:
#   pull_request_target runs with base repo context (and can access secrets)
#   If the workflow then checks out PR HEAD and executes it, untrusted code can run with those secrets.
# THIS LAB REPLACES dangerous behavior with safe no-op verification steps.
